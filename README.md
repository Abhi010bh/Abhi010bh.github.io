Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and experiences through various technologies.

## Technologies Used:

1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: These foundational web technologies are used to structure, style, and add interactivity to the website.

2. **Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS**: Both Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have been utilized to enhance the design and layout of the website. These frameworks provide pre-designed components and utilities to streamline the development process and ensure a responsive design.

3. **jQuery**: jQuery has been employed to create a screen size-based modal on the homepage. This allows for a dynamic and user-friendly experience, adapting to different device sizes seamlessly.

Feel free to explore the website to learn more about me and my projects! If you have any feedback or questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
